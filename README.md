# Movie-Recommender-System

**Built by : Dhruv Tuli**
A Web Base user-item Movie Recommendation Engine using Collaborative Filtering By matrix factorizations algorithm and
The recommendation based on the underlying idea that is if two persons both liked certian common movies,then the movies that one person has liked that the other person has not yet watched can be recommended to him.   
## System Architecture

The recommendation system utilizes **Collaborative Filtering** via **Matrix Factorization**. It models user-movie interactions by mapping both users and movies to a joint latent factor space, enabling accurate predictions of unseen movies.

graph TD
    A[Users] -->|Rate/Interact| B(Movies)
    B --> C{User-Item Rating Matrix}
    C -->|Matrix Factorization| D[User Latent Features]
    C -->|Matrix Factorization| E[Movie Latent Features]
    D --> F{Dot Product}
    E --> F
    F -->|Calculate Missing Ratings| G[Predicted Ratings Matrix]
    G -->|Sort & Filter| H[Top N Recommendations]
    H --> A
